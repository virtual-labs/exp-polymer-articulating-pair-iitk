### About the Experiment 

Wear is defined as "damage to a solid surface, usually involving progressive loss of material, due to relative motion between that surface and a contacting substance or substances." Understanding wear is crucial for predicting the performance and life of the components. Moreover, wear behaviour is significant in a variety of domains, including materials science and life sciences.
